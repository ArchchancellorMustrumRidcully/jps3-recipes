# Objective-See

## Notice Tue Apr 23rd.

I _really_ wanted to believe in these Objective-See tools. Over the years I had donated to their Patreon, delighted at the various presentations recorded and released on YouTube, created the AutoPkg recipes, and generally felt very good about all of it. It was really nice to have Mac-focused security tools.

I also _really_ wanted to believe in the Objective-by-the-Sea Mac-focused security conference. The first year (2018) it was in Hawaii, the organizer's home base. My only issue was personal, there was no way I could at that time personally afford to attend. My employer, a University, effectively does not fund training or conference attendance for staff. There is no parity or opportunity to attend anything that will require any significant travel or lodgings. Also, it will be denied based on _where_ they are if it is at all of the appearance to be more of a "vacation" than work-related, regardless of whether one would have to endure a 15-20 hour flight with one or more stop-overs (perhaps even overnight) arriving at the destination just in time for the conference opening and leaving immediately after it ends. ("Just sleep on the flights and take lots of notes. Also we will cover lodging or food at a luxury destination.") 

So, what happened to these recipes?

I just noted that the 2nd iteration of the Objective-by-the-Sea conference is in ... **MONTE «deleted» CARLO** this year. Are you «deleted» kidding me? While I would _love_ to hear many of the speakers, and would dearly _love_ to talk with other Mac and security nerds, this is ridiculous. **Only** rich people can attend these things. Lately I cannot but help feel that the security industry has made a complex of itself, removed themselves from reality, expect and demand luxury and obscene pay.

Why should I continue to respect anyone in this industry? If you're not on the inside, you're an outsider and will be kept out. The frequent pleas for inclusivity, the cries of their being a dearth of talent are falling flat with me now.

I believed.

I don't believe any more.
