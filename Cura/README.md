## Notes

1) Monday; November 2, 2015 - discovered that [latest.xml](http://software.ultimaker.com/latest.xml) returns different data than [latest.json](http://software.ultimaker.com/latest.json). The XML version appears to be current release, and the JSON appears to be BETA. Nothing in that data appears to qualify this assumption, but that is how it appears.
	_My apologies to anyone/everyone who has been using this and finding themselves with the beta releases!_
